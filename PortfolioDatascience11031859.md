# Python for Datascience
As Software Engineering student I had experience with python for a couple of years. Although I thought I knew the most from the early parts of the Datacamp Courses, I was suprised to see there is plenty of more to learn. I had experience with the certain libraries like numpy but didn't know the inner workings until I started learning it with Data Camp. Furthermore, I didn't have much experience with most Data Science libraries, but they were explained pretty well with the Datacamp courses.
